PROJECT OVERVIEW:
We are creating a professional-grade, production-ready website for "Sinco", a viral TikTok trend. The site must be visually stunning, highly performant, and easy for a non-technical person to update.

---
CORE REQUIREMENTS:

1. Brand & Theme
- Forest theme with animated leaves moving in the background.
- Recommend the best color scheme that matches a viral social presence but maintains professionalism.
- Reference previous projects in directories "lizard-tapper" and "lizard-merch-website" for animation inspiration.
- Ensure smooth, modern animations that do not compromise mobile performance.

2. Social Integration
- Prominently link TikTok and Instagram accounts:
  TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@sinco.00
  Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/sinco.00
- Dynamically embed TikTok videos as they are posted, if possible.
- If dynamic embedding is not possible, build a system to easily add new videos/images without coding.

3. Memecoin Contract Address
- Display the memecoin contract address prominently.
- Include a one-click "Copy to Clipboard" button with instant visual confirmation (e.g., tooltip or animation).

4. Content Management
- Create a method for Ethan to easily upload and display pictures/videos.
- Optimize for fast loading and high performance.

5. Hosting
- Host somewhere other than Vercel.
- Recommend and justify the best hosting option for global performance (Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, DigitalOcean, etc.).
- Set up deployment so Ethan can update without touching code.

6. Technical Standards
- Fully responsive, WCAG-accessible, SEO-optimized.
- Modular, scalable code structure.
- Production-quality performance optimizations (minification, lazy loading, code splitting).

---
MINDSET:
- Always think: "If I were the product owner, what would I want?"
- Suggest additional features to improve user engagement and viral potential.
- Provide step-by-step guidance for every change so Ethan can manage the site independently.
- Assume this site is going straight to productionâ€”no shortcuts.

---
DELIVERABLES:
- Complete codebase.
- README.md with instructions for:
  - Updating media.
  - Updating the contract address.
  - Deploying and maintaining the site.
- Hosting recommendation and setup plan.
